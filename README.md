# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Chatbot

This is my first minor project during my semester 5 . Using this chatbot you can detect the sentiment of a person such as anger,sad,happy,love.
Our chat bot uses a flask as a user friendly interface to ask a set of 5 questions from the answers given to the question we detect the sentiment
of the person.
